# STUDENT FILES: The api Directory

## Contents
The ADT files are kept here. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS DIRECTORY. Your task is to implement
and test the given ADT.

The ADT is specified as a Java interface. Do not change this file. Only the software architect or designer is allowed to change the ADT. If you make changes, your implementation will not likely pass the project's unit tests, EVEN IF THEY PASS YOUR TESTS.

## How to generate the instructions for this assignment:
1. In Eclipse, right-click the ADT java file (inside this api folder) and select Export>Java>JavaDoc
2. Note the destination (look for this in the bottom 1/3 of the dialog box. The default is a "doc" folder in this eclipse project. I suggest you use this default.
3. Click Finish
4. Find the index.html file and double click it.
5. Pay careful attention to this file. It is the documentation for the ADT you are to implement and
test.
