# Recursion 270 Fall17

## Basic Workflow

To work on this assignment you must CLONE this project from gitlab.pcs.cnu.edu. There is NO need to
fork.

Note that you will not be able to push to the cpsc270-students gitlab.

## Different from CPSC150

Unlike in CPSC150 or other classes, you don't use git to submit your code. You will use
eclipse to submit your assignments to web-cat.cs.vt.edu.

## To use eclipse to clone this project:
1. copy the git URI for this project
2. open eclipse.
3. right click in the package explorer and select import>Git>Projects from Git and click next.
4. Select Clone URI and click next. You will see that the URI has been pre-populated because you copied the URI (step 1)
5. Select the appropriate protocol (ssh or https). click next.
6. On the next dialog box, verify that "master" is selected. click next.
7. On the next dialog box, click browse, navigate to your local git repository, and create a new folder with the same name as the git project you are cloning. click next.
8. On the next dialog box, select import existing Eclipse project. click next. This will create an eclipse project that you can work on for this assignment.

## Disconnect your new eclipse project from cpsc270-students
1. Right-click the eclipse project that was created. Select Team>disconnect. This removes the connection to the cpsc270-students repo.
2. In the Git Repositories view in eclipse, right-click the asg repository you just imported. Select "Delete Repository...:
3. In the dialog box that appears, select "Delete Git repository data and history" and click ok.

Once you have an eclipse project, open the api directory and read the README.md file.

You can use the git CLI to connect your eclipse project to a local repository for backup purposes.

## HONOR CODE WARNING

NOTE WELL: it is an honor code violation to publish your assignment code. This specifically means you are not allowed to push your assignment to a git server that is accessible by anyone other than you and the instructor.
