# Implementing the ADT

## What to put in src
Keep all the implementation files here (the api directory contains the ADT). Note that it is best to
generate the implementation shell (initial code) from the ADT as demonstrated in class.

## Implement ALL ADT methods
You must implement ALL the methods specified in the ADT. These must be public.

## Do not copy/paste/rewrite the ADT javadoc
Do NOT change any of the javadoc for the ADT methods. Specifically DO NOT copy/paste or rewrite the javadoc from the ADT. Notice the regular java comments in the implementation (src) contain the annotations @see RationalADT#setNum(java.lang.Integer) and @Override. These will cause the proper javadoc to be generated for the implementation.

## Add any needed constructors
You must add any needed constructors. These are the ONLY non-ADT methods that are to be public. You must write your own javadoc for any constructor you write.

## Add any needed non-public methods and fields
You may add any non-public methods and fields to your implementation. You must write your own javadoc for any of these methods and fields.
